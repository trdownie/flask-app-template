            <p>Welcome to The Art of Film.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lg-text">
            <p>This site is for the cinephiles; the lovers of the beautiful and divine craft that is filmmaking.</p>
            <p>The intention of the site is to harbour that divine spark within each of us to truly engage with film,
                to share that passion, and to find more precious testaments to its power over our human existence.</p>
            <p>Within this site, you’ll find an index of films that are ranked using a special system that combines
                    five metrics to create a film’s Ultimate Score. These metrics focus on the artistic nature of filmmaking,
                    but as we all know, art is a subjective business, one person’s trash is another person’s treasure.</p>
            <p>The five metrics are:<br><b>
            •	Visual appeal<br>
            •	Auditory appeal<br>
            •	Dialogue<br>
            •	Emotive impact<br>
            •	Symbolism</b><p>
            <p>Each of the metrics is explored in more detail below. Upon reviewing a film, users submit their ranking for
                each metric out of a maximum score of 10. Films are then averaged across these ranks and assigned an
                Ultimate Score, a master determinant of a film’s worth.</p>
            <p>There is no way to add a score without reviewing a film, but your reviews can be as short and succinct
                as you like, provided you leave a minimum of 10 characters.</p>
            <p>You are invited to add any films you like, so that others can give their verdict. You can delete your own
                reviews anytime, but films can only be deleted if there are no reviews attached to them.</p>
            <p>Please explore and enjoy the site, fellow cinephile.</p>

    <!-------------------------------------------- METRICS -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="hidden">Metrics</h2>
        <div class="lg-text">
            <h2 class="center-align">Visual Appeal</h2>
            <p>The Visual Appeal metric measures (wait for it…) how visually appealing you find the film.
                Visual storytelling, location, set and costume design, colour palette, and even the props used
                can factor into your verdict for this metric. The definition of your TV is less important here.</p>
            <h2 class="center-align">Auditory Appeal</h2>
            <p>The Auditory Appeal metric follows visual appeal in being self-explanatory. Here, common factors include
                the soundtrack, the sound effects, any background noise, the dramatism used, and the timing of delivery
                of such auditory cues. Try not to use your own involuntary shrieks as significant factors, however.</p>
            <h2 class="center-align">Dialogue</h2>
            <p>The Dialogue metric attempts to gauge just how well-written the dialogue in the film is. To some,
                this means it means pleasingly poetic; to others, it means poignantly pithy; to others still,
                it means painfully prosaic. You get my drift.</p>
            <h2 class="center-align">Emotive Impact</h2>
            <p>The Emotive Impact metric tries to quantify the emotional impact of the film. Which emotions it has garnered,
                how strongly, and how impactful these emotions have been on the way you view your life and the world are all
                good determinants here. How angry you were when you couldn’t find the remote, less so.</p>
            <h2 class="center-align">Symbolism</h2>
            <p>Finally, the Symbolism metric determines the depth of the artistic creation upon which you have feasted your retinas,
                but as with all deeper insights, this one can be the hardest to judge. Still, it can also be the most rewarding.
                I’m sure anyone can piece together the symbolic nature of the labyrinth in Pan’s Labyrinth or the clowns in Joker,
                but what about the role of oranges in The Godfather, or deer in Get Out, or water in Moonlight? Luckily, you can
                make some things up for good measure; Titanic was about capitalism, right?</p>
